Target SQL project
Project Description:
Target is a globally renowned brand and a prominent retailer in the United States. Target makes itself a preferred shopping destination by offering outstanding value, inspiration, innovation and an exceptional guest experience that no other retailer can deliver. 
This particular business case focuses on the operations of Target in Brazil and provides insightful information about 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. The dataset offers a comprehensive view of various dimensions including the order status, price, payment and freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews.
By analyzing this extensive dataset, it becomes possible to gain valuable insights into Target's operations in Brazil. The information can shed light on various aspects of the business, such as order processing, pricing strategies, payment and shipping efficiency, customer demographics, product characteristics, and customer satisfaction levels.

Insights:

1. Based on the customer distribution, there are states like RN, MA , PB are comparatively lesser. Therefore, looking at the population proportion we can implement steps to increase the customers in these areas. For example: we can look at the age proportion in the areas and have more need-based products in there. Or we can give discounts on the products bought more in those areas.

2. Based on the difference in business between the different months and seasons there could be discounts given during the months like December where the business is less, on specific products like decorative items or clothes. 

3. The business during dawn is the least also morning and night are less, there could be some discount coupons and special discount given during these times to boost the business during these periods.

4. As per the delivery time, we can work on the states with large delivery time and provide viable transportation modes as per the demographics or set up more warehouses to stock products nearby to reduce the delivery time.

5. As per the difference between actual delivery and estimated delivery time we can work on reducing the gap between the two so that customers will be more lured to buy the products and won't hesitate because of the estimated time.

6. The states where the freight values are more, we can work on clubbing more deliveries together which would fall in the same region and scheduling the deliveries accordingly so the cost of freight reduces, or we can look at other cheaper modes of transportation that would be viable. 

7. Based on the number of orders and payment installments there could be no-cost-emi option, or some sort of discount provided on taking the emi option so people buy more expensive products and pay on installments even though they can't afford to buy those at once which can help boost up the business.
